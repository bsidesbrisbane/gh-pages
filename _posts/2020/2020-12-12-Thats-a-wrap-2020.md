## Great turnout!
We had a great turnout for BSides Brisbane 2020, with a total of 335 tickets sold, even after having to move the dates, and the looming COVID lockdowns. It was a great event overall, fantastic content and a great bunch of people. We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who attended, gave presentations, participated in events, and those that sponsored. 

If you want to check it out, you can [download the booklet from the day](/assets/2020/booklet/booklet.pdf).

## Cyber Escape Room: Critical Mass
This year we could put on an escape room. The event was supported by CyberCX and Living Security. Named Critical Massâ€™, an escape room about the tipping point, understanding current and next-level security concepts on a fundamental level to help improve secure decision making. This room focused on basic enterprise awareness as well as concepts that are not traditionally taught to end users. Learning concepts included social engineering, securing sensitive data, phishing awareness, RFID security, lock picking, blackmailing, catfishing, and doxxing.

## Presenter summary
The following presenters provided great content for our audience, a few of them have released their presentations online - it would be worth reaching out to them or checking their LinkedIn/Twitter (X) profiles for links.
