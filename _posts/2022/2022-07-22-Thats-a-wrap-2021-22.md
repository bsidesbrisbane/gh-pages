## Great turnout!
This year ended up a combined conference for 2021 and 2022 as we had to postpone for COVID lockdown. Even with that, we had yet another great turnout for BSides Brisbane in 2022, with a total of 390 tickets sold. 

If you want to check it out, you can [download the booklet from the day](/assets/2022/booklet/booklet.pdf).

## Presenter summary
The following presenters provided great content for our audience, a few of them have released their presentations online - it would be worth reaching out to them or checking their LinkedIn/Twitter (X) profiles for links.
