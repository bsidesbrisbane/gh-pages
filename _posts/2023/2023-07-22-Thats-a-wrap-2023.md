## Our biggest year yet!
BSides Brisbane 2023 proved to be an outstanding success, setting new benchmarks for our community engagement and overall participation - with a total of 478 tickets sold, and an impressive 400 check-ins, which has been much higher than previous year as COVID still lingers.

This overwhelming response not only attested to the conference's ability to attract a broad audience but also highlighted the demand for a platform like BSides Brisbane to bring together professionals, enthusiasts, those looking to get into the industry, as well as experts already in the cybersecurity field.

## Presenter summary
The following presenters provided great content for our audience, a few of them have released their presentations online - it would be worth reaching out to them or checking their LinkedIn/Twitter profiles for links.

## VetsInCyber and BrothersNBooks
This year we partnered with [VetsInCyber](https://vetsincyber.com.au/) and [BrothersNBooks](https://brothersnbooks.com/) for a community book donation. These books will be placed on barracks for service members, in hospitals for those recovering from injury and other community libraries across the country. With the goal to promote reading as a means of therapy, personal growth, success and help educate and bring new members into the cyber security industry.

As a result of the drive, we were able to assist with donating around 20 books to this great cause.
