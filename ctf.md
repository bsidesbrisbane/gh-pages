## Capture The Flag
### What Is A CTF Event?
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity event or competition that is used to test and develop computer security skills. It was first developed in 1996 at DEF CON, the largest cybersecurity conference in the United States which is hosted annually in Las Vegas.

BSides Brisbane run two popular CTF formats, a jeopardy style, and a domain based AD attack scenario. Both formats test participantâ€™s knowledge in cybersecurity, but differ in objective. In the Jeopardy format, participating teams must complete as many challenges of varying point values from a various categories such as cryptography, web exploitation, and reverse engineering. The AD attack scenario builds out more of a real world exercise that brings participating teams on a journey from compromise of external systems, pivoting to internal systems and privilege escalation within a domain environment.

### Why Participate
There are several reasons as to why you may want to participate in a capture the flag event.
